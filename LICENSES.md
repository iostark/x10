X10 Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs and VARs
---------------------------------------------- 

IO Stark provides its X10 Libraries under 
a dual license model designed to meet the development
and distribution needs of both commercial projects 
(such as OEMs, ISVs and VARs) and open source projects.

For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors),
VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and distribute
commercially licensed software with X10 software and do not wish to distribute
the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 2 of the
GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial license
agreement with IO Stark.

Please contact IO Stark to obtain a license.

For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications:
-------------------------------------------------

For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL
that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with X10 software,
IO Stark’s X10 open source software licensed under the GPL is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license
other than the GPL, IO Stark makes its GPL-licensed X10 Client Libraries
available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the those X10 Client
Libraries under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work
to be subject to the GPL.

What is the FOSS License Exception?
--------------------------

IO Stark’s Free and Open Source Software ("FOSS") License Exception (formerly
known as the FLOSS License Exception) allows developers of FOSS applications to
include IO Stark's X10 Client Libraries 
with their FOSS applications. X10 Client Libraries are
typically licensed pursuant to version 2 of the General Public License ("GPL"),
but this exception permits distribution of certain X10 Client Libraries with
a developer’s FOSS applications licensed under the terms of another FOSS
license listed below, even though such other FOSS license may be incompatible
with the GPL.

The following terms and conditions describe the circumstances under which
IO Stark’s FOSS License Exception applies.

IO Stark’s FOSS License Exception Terms and Conditions

Definitions.

"Derivative Work" means a derivative work, as defined under applicable
copyright law, formed entirely from the Program and one or more FOSS
Applications.

"FOSS Application" means a free and open source software application
distributed subject to a license listed in the section below titled "FOSS
License List."

"FOSS Notice" means a notice placed by IO Stark or X10 in a copy of the X10
Client Libraries stating that such copy of the X10 Client Libraries may be
distributed under IO Stark's X10’s FOSS (or FLOSS) License Exception.

"Independent Work" means portions of the Derivative Work that are not derived
from the Program and can reasonably be considered independent and separate
works.

"Program" means a copy of IO Stark’s X10 Client Libraries that contains a FOSS
Notice.  A FOSS application developer ("you" or "your") may distribute a
Derivative Work provided that you and the Derivative Work meet all of the
following conditions:

You obey the GPL in all respects for the Program and all portions (including
modifications) of the Program included in the Derivative Work (provided that
this condition does not apply to Independent Works); The Derivative Work does
not include any work licensed under the GPL other than the Program; You
distribute Independent Works subject to a license listed in the section below
titled "FOSS License List"; You distribute Independent Works in object code or
executable form with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code on
the same medium and under the same FOSS license applying to the object code or
executable forms; All works that are aggregated with the Program or the
Derivative Work on a medium or volume of storage are not derivative works of
the Program, Derivative Work or FOSS Application, and must reasonably be
considered independent and separate works.  IO Stark reserves all rights not
expressly granted in these terms and conditions. If all of the above conditions
are not met, then this FOSS License Exception does not apply to you or your
Derivative Work.
